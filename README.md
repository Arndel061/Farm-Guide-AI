# 🌾 Farm-Guide AI

**Farm-Guide AI** is a smart farming assistant designed to help farmers — especially in rural Nigeria — diagnose crop problems, receive instant remedies, and get practical tips to boost harvests. It combines AI with local agricultural knowledge to empower food producers.

## 💡 Problem It Solves

Many farmers lose crops due to:

Farm-Guide AI tackles these by offering:
- 🧠 AI-powered symptom checker
- 🌿 Remedies based on locally available materials
- 🌦️ Smart tips based on season and climate
- 📱 Accessible via mobile/web (even with low bandwidth)

1. **Farmer inputs crop issue** (e.g. "leaves turning yellow")
2. **AI diagnoses likely disease** or nutrient issue
3. **Farm-Guide recommends** affordable, local remedies
